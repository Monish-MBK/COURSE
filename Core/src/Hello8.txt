Method overriding happens when both parent and child class have a method with same name and same parameters
when you call the method by creating an object of child class it will call the child class method only and not parent class method


Packages are basically name of a folder where in every file need to mention its package name
A file can only access other files in the same class but if we need to access files of another folder we need to import that particular package
