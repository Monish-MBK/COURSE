Before using JWT we need to add some dependencies
1.jjwt:impl
2.jjwt:api
3.jjwt:extention:jackson

Next we need to generate a secret key for which we are creating a class inside test folder
once we have a secret key, we need to generate a token

create a class jwtservice and add secret key as a static final variable inside the class and crete a function to generate a token
